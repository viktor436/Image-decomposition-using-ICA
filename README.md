# Image decomposition using Independent Component Analysis(ICA)

This notebook demonstrates how to use Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to separate an image into independent components.

## Prerequisites

Before running the notebook, make sure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- scikit-learn

You can install the required packages by running the following command:

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

2. Ensure that the `mixed.jpg` file is in the same directory as the notebook.

3. Run the notebook using a Jupyter Notebook environment or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports Jupyter notebooks.

4. The notebook will load the `mixed.jpg` image, apply ICA to separate the image into foreground and background components, and display the results.

## License

Feel free to modify and use the code according to your needs.
